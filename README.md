üîå Zignode ‚Äì Zero-Effort, Self-Discovering RPC for Python (and Beyond)

Zignode is a lightweight framework that turns any script (Python and potentially others) into a smart, networked node ‚Äî often with just a single line of code in Python.
Forget about manual server configuration and request handling. Simply expose your functions and let the nodes discover, communicate, and collaborate automatically on your local network.

This project was born from the practical needs of an electronics enthusiast: how to easily control devices connected to a Raspberry Pi (or similar systems) without writing a dedicated server for each project?
Zignode is the answer, offering a universal and instant solution.

Although originally implemented in Python, the Zignode protocol is language-agnostic. Support for other platforms (e.g., Arduino/C++, Node.js) is actively being explored.
‚ú® Key Features

    ‚öôÔ∏è Effortless Python Integration
    Just call zignode.auto(locals()) at the end of your script ‚Äî and all your functions become available on the network.

    üåê Automatic Network Discovery
    Nodes scan the local network to find others ‚Äî no config files, no central server required.

    üßê Intelligent Function Routing
    Zignode builds a "mesh mind" across the network. If a function isn't available locally, it automatically forwards the call to the right node ‚Äî even via 2-hop neighbors.

    üéØ Flexible Execution
    Call functions with positional (args) or keyword arguments (kwargs). Target a specific node by its ID or let the network choose the best node for the job.

    üñ•Ô∏è Broad Platform Support
    Robust, out-of-the-box operation on Linux, Windows, and macOS, including native notifications and Text-to-Speech.

    üß± Built-in Web UI
    Each node hosts a web interface with its function list, status info, and discovered neighbors.

    üõéÔ∏è Integrated Utilities
    Optional built-in helpers: msg(), notif(), and an improved speak() for cross-platform notifications and TTS.

    ü¶¶ Lightweight & Interoperable
    Fully async (aiohttp, netifaces2), using standard HTTP/JSON ‚Äî works great with ESP32, MicroPython, and is extendable to C++/Arduino/Node.js.

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

    Python 3.8+

    Automatically installs:

        aiohttp

        netifaces2

üì¶ Installation

pip install zignode

üß™ Usage Example (Python)

#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import zignode

def set_servo_position(position: int, speed: int = 100):
    print(f"SERVO: Setting position to {position} degrees at speed {speed}.")
    return f"Servo position set to {position}."

def read_temperature():
    temp = 23.5
    print(f"SENSOR: Read temperature: {temp}¬∞C")
    return {"temperature": temp, "unit": "Celsius"}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    zignode.auto(
        external_locals=locals(),
        debug=True,
        manual_node_list=[('192.168.1.101', 8635)]
    )

üì° How It Works

Zignode creates a peer-to-peer network where every node is equal.

Startup

    The node starts a local HTTP server and begins scanning the network.

Discovery

    On port 8635, Zignode discovers others, exchanging available functions and neighbors.

Execution

    When a call is made:

        If the function exists locally ‚Üí execute.

        Else ‚Üí check neighbors.

        If needed ‚Üí 2-hop route via neighbor‚Äôs neighbors.

This builds a self-healing, mesh-style RPC network.
üì¨ How to Call Functions

You can use any HTTP client (curl, requests, Postman) to call functions on any node. The payload is a JSON object defining the call, args (list), kwargs (object), and optional id.
1. Call a function with positional arguments (args):

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"call": "set_servo_position", "args": [90]}' \
http://localhost:8635/

2. Call a function with keyword arguments (kwargs):

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"call": "set_servo_position", "kwargs": {"position": 180, "speed": 50}}' \
http://localhost:8635/

3. Call a function on a specific node (by ID):

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"call": "read_temperature", "id": "a1b2c3d4-..."}' \
http://localhost:8635/

4. Send a message in another language using kwargs:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"call": "msg", "args": ["Wiadomo≈õƒá z sieci!"], "kwargs": {"language": "polish"}}' \
http://localhost:8635/

üóê Web UI

Each node automatically hosts a web page at http://<ip>:8635/, showing:

    Node ID

    Available functions

    Discovered neighbors

    Optional logs
